                    <p>
                        I am a frontend developer who is always learning, with a special interest in acessibility and efficiency. I love creating hyper-organized projects from beginning to end. My background in design and freelance gives me a unique understanding of all areas of a development project, and how they all work together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With intense attention to detail, and an innate love of research, I love working with static site generators. They give me the ability to control all aspects of the web development process and end product. A useable website <em>and</em> content management system are both equally as important.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aside from all the tech, I enjoy gaming, repair and restoration projects, and trying new things. 
                    </p>
