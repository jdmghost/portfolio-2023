The website received an Honourable Mention for Awwwards, as well as Mobile Excellence.

After designing their new website according to their recent rebrand, I developed the rescue shelter a highly customized WordPress website with ACF. Integrating their new CRM was a fun challenge for this project to create a highly customized Adopt page, with automatically generating unique pet pages.
