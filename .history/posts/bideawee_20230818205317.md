summary: The new Manoverboard website development for our brand refresh.
---

January 2022, the website won three statuses from awwwards.com: Site of the Day, Honourable Mention, and the Developer Award.

Taking on the lead for this development project has been a blessing and a curse. Working with ambitious designers definitely sets the bar for expectations really high. It allowed me to push past “good enough” and really get the little things right. I learned a lot about GSAP animation, Barba.js, and their limitations.

Overall, this site really is a medley of tech, and will forever be a work in progress, as a studio’s own website usually is.
