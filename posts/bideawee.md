## Design
Bideawee went through a major rebrand, but kept their signature blue and yellow. The two colours posed an accessibility challenge. 

## Development 
The site is mostly running on WordPress, which was highly customoized with ACF. Their adopt pages run through a separate CRM and had to be called in using their API. 

The site features a custom scrolling experience, and subtle animations using JavaScript and GSAP.

## Awards
The website received an [Awwards Honourable Mention](https://www.awwwards.com/sites/bideawee#color-typography).
